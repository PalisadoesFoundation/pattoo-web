How To Contribute

Introduction
------------

Below is the workflow for having your contribution accepted into the ``pattoo-web`` repository.

#. Create an Issue or comment on an existing issue to discuss the feature
#. If the feature is approved, assign the issue to yourself
#. Fork the project
#. Clone the fork to your local machine
#. Add the original project as a remote (git remote add upstream https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/pattoo-web, check with: git remote -v)
#. Create a topic branch for your change (git checkout -b ``BranchName``\ )
#. you may create additional branches if modifying multiple parts of the code
#. Write code and Commit your changes locally. An example of a proper ``git commit`` message can be seen below:

    .. code-block::

        Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete ...

        Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
        document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
        contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
        based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
        problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

        The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
        from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
        why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.

        Resolves Issue: #123
        See also: #456, #789

#. When you need to synch with upstream (pull the latest changes from main repo into your current branch), do:

     #. ``git fetch upstream``
     #. ``git merge upstream/master``

#. Check for unnecessary white space with ``git diff --check``.
#. Write the necessary unit tests for your changes.
#. Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken
#. Push your changes to your forked repository (git push origin ``branch``\ )
#. Perform a pull request on GitHub
#. Your code will be reviewed
#. If your code passes review, your pull request will be accepted

Code Style Guide
----------------

For ease of readability and maintainability code for all ``pattoo`` projects must follow these guidelines. Code that does not comply will not be added to the ``master`` branch.

#. All ``pattoo`` projects use the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Exceptions>`_ for general style requirements
#. All ``pattoo`` python projects use the The Chromium Projects Python Style Guidelines for docstrings.
#. Indentations must be multiples of 4 blank spaces. No tabs.
#. All strings must be enclosed in single quotes
#. In addition too being ``pylint`` compliant, the code must be PEP8 and PEP257 compliant too.
#. There should be no trailing spaces in files

Guidelines to remember
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Always opt for the most pythonic solution to a problem
* Avoid applying idioms from other programming languages
* Import each module with its full path name. ie: from pack.subpack import module
* `Use exceptions where appropriate <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Exceptions>`_
* `Use doc strings <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
* Try not to have returns at multiple points in a function unless they are failure state returns.
* If you are in the middle of a development session and have to interrupt your work, it is a good idea to write a broken unit test about what you want to develop next. When coming back to work, you will have a pointer to where you were and get back on track faster.

Commits
^^^^^^^

The ``pattoo`` projects strive to maintain a proper log of development through well structured git commits. The links below offer insight and advice on the topic of commit messages:

Sample .vimrc File for Compliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use this sample .vimrc file to help meet our style requirements

.. code-block::

   " Activate syntax
   syntax on
   " set number

   " Disable automatic comment insertion
   autocmd FileType * setlocal formatoptions-=c formatoptions-=r formatoptions-=o

   " Delete trailing whitespace
   autocmd BufWritePre * :%s/\s\+$//e

   " Convert tabs to spaces
   set expandtab

   " Set tabs to 4 spaces
   set tabstop=4

   " Set the number of spaces for indentation
   set shiftwidth=4

   " Switch on highlighting the last used search pattern when the terminal has colors
   if &t_Co > 2 || has("gui_running")
     set hlsearch
   endif

   " Tell vim to remember certain things when we exit
   "  '10  :  marks will be remembered for up to 10 previously edited files
   "  "100 :  will save up to 100 lines for each register
   "  :20  :  up to 20 lines of command-line history will be remembered
   "  %    :  saves and restores the buffer list
   "  n... :  where to save the viminfo files
   set viminfo='10,\"100,:20,%,n~/.viminfo

   " Function for viminfo to work
   function! ResCur()
     if line("'\"") <= line("$")
       normal! g`"
       return 1
     endif
   endfunction

   " Function for viminfo to work
   augroup resCur
     autocmd!
     autocmd BufWinEnter * call ResCur()
   augroup END
