About Pattoo
============

``pattoo`` allows you to use your web browser to chart your organization's constantly changing data.

It was inspired by the need to collect and visualize data from various DevOps, network, industrial PLC controllers, electro-mechanical and enterprise systems on a single web dashboard.

This data is collected by ``pattoo`` agents. There are standard agents for:

* Linux
* SNMP
* Modbus TCP
* Bacnet/IP
* OPC UA

With programming skill, you can create your own custom agents if needed.

Operational Overview
--------------------

``pattoo`` has a number of inter-related components. `You can see how they all work together on the pattoo web page. <https://palisadoesfoundation.github.io/pattoo.github.io/>`_


The Palisadoes Foundation
-------------------------

``pattoo`` is based on the original ``infoset`` code created by the `Palisadoes Foundation <http://www.palisadoes.org>`_ as part of its annual Calico Challenge program. Calico provides paid summer internships for  Jamaican university students to work on selected open source projects. They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015.
